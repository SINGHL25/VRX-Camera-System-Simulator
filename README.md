 a comprehensive VRX Camera System Simulator with full 3D visualization, interactive controls, and training capabilities. The platform features a realistic 3D scene showing vehicle movement through trigger lines with an animated camera rig, dynamic sliders for adjusting mounting height, trigger distance, focus, tilt angle, and FOV, plus live geometry calculations that provide real-time feedback on image quality scores. The analytics section includes interactive charts showing accuracy vs tilt angle and focus sharpness graphs, while an AI assistant analyzes your configuration and provides intelligent suggestions for optimization. The Dashboard displays KPIs, multi-lane performance metrics, 24-hour analytics, and includes the reference architecture diagrams you provided. Training Mode offers a step-by-step tutorial with 7 comprehensive lessons covering everything from VRX basics to system calibration, each with interactive quizzes to test understanding. The Knowledge Base provides searchable definitions, formulas, and examples with bookmarking functionality for quick reference.

Next steps you might consider:
Add vehicle speed variation controls to see how it affects capture timing
Implement weather/lighting condition simulation (rain, fog, night)
Create export functionality for configuration reports and training completion certificates
